CODING TRICKS

-SWITCHES-
EXAMPLE WITHIN: "tenMinuteWalk.java"
"You use a switch statement when you are switching on different values of primitive / enum / wrapper types. (And not all primitive / wrapper types, just the supported ones - byte, short, char, int)." - danben, Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2103080/when-to-use-a-switch-statement-in-java)

"...I'd suggest that it's usually preferable to use switch over if/else if if you're dealing with numeric or enum types." - Kirby, Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2103080/when-to-use-a-switch-statement-in-java)

Use Switches with byte, short, char, and int objects to iterate through a series of cases, similar to an if/else loop. Preferable to use with numeric or enum types.


-RECURSION-
EXAMPLE WITHIN: "recIntoSquare.java"
"A method that calls itself is known as a recursive method. And, this technique is known as recursion.

A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively." - Programiz (https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/recursion)

"class Factorial {
    static int factorial( int n ) {
        if (n != 0)
            return n * factorial(n-1); // recursive call
        else
            return 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 4, result;
        result = factorial(number);
        System.out.println(number + " factorial = " + result);
    }
}" - Programiz (https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/recursion)

Use recursion with a problem that requires the same action repeated until a certain point. Recursion generally uses more memory and is slow, but are simpler to write, debug, and maintain. Preferable to use for more clarity and time reduction.


-ARRAYS.STREAM()-
EXAMPLE WITHIN: "highAndLow.java"
"static <Type> Stream<Type>
stream(Type[] array, [ int startInclusive, int endExclusive ])
Returns a sequential Stream [with the specified range] of the specified array as its source." -  Oracle Docs (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html)

 Use Arrays.stream() when the items in an array need to be sorted or analyzed quickly and efficiently. Preferable when converting a string of numbers into an array of integers to be processed (max, min, sort)
